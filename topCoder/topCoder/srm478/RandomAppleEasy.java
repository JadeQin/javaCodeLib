/**
 * Problem Statement
    
Taro likes apples very much. He has N boxes numbered from 0 to N-1. Box i contains red[i] red apples and green[i] 
green apples. He decided to choose one apple from his boxes, and he does so in the following way: 
First Step: He chooses a non-empty subset of his N boxes randomly and transfers all apples from those boxes to 
another box (this is a box other than the original N boxes and it is initially empty). Each non-empty subset of 
boxes has the same probability of being chosen. 
Second Step: He chooses one apple from the new box randomly. Each apple in the box has the same probability of 
being chosen.
Return the probability that Taro chooses a red apple.

-
red will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-
red and green will contain the same number of elements.
-
Each element of red and green will be between 1 and 10, inclusive.
